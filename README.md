PyQt5 is a python 3 module that allows for rapid development of GUI applications using its built in program Qt-Designer. PyQt5 runs on all operating systems which means all of the code you write will scale. This tutorial series will focus on the basics of PyQt and creating useable GUI's. In this video I discuss how to download and install pyqt for windows and setup a basic gui application.

### Installation
```
pip install PyQt5
pip install pyqt5-tools
```

### Convert `.ui` to `.py`
```
pyuic5 -x test.ui -o test.py
```
